# WhatsApp Web API Automation using Selenium
This is a project on Automation Of Whatsapp Web using Selenium developed under a competition known as Hack 4.0 organised by CSEC-NITH on 15th-16th of February, Powered by Bugsee. The Automated WhatsApp Web App incorporates features like reading new messages, replying to users, creating new groups, sending media, blocking contacts, logging out, etc.
# Getting Started
These intructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.
# Pre-requisites
- Python 3 interpretor installed from [here](https:/www.python.org).
- Any Python 3 IDE, preferably PyCharm or VS Code.
- Google Chrome Installed Version 80 or Higher.
# Installing 
- Install Selenium (pip install Selenium).
- Install Beautiful Soup (pip install bs4).
- Install Chrome Web Driver (you can download the compatible zip from [here](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads).
# Running The Tests
### You need to provide the correct path for the chrome driver according to your system.
- For Windows, the path should look something like this C:\Users\SomeUser\Downloads\google-chrome-stable_current_amd64
- For Linux, the path should look something like this /home/user-name/Downloads/google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.deb
- For Mac, the path should look something like this /Users/user-name/Downloads/google-chrome-stable_current_amd64
### Setting up WhatsApp Web
- Once you run the python file, Google Chrome should pop up opening WhatsApp Web.
- Login after the scanning the QR Code.
- If the program ends with the error, you need to extend the time of time.sleep() function to something greater value depending on your network speed.
- Once Login is successfull you will never need to Login again, even if you close the browser window as long as you do not log out.
### Using The API
- Once the above procedures are done, use the correct function calls to do different tasks.
- You can use a combination of different functions to generate different results.
